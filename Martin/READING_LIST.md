> Vempala and Vetta [9], the algorithm by Ng, Jordan and Weiss [11], and the
> Multicut algorithm by Meila and Shi [10], as well as Single and Ward linkage
> as a base for comparison. They also combined different parts of different
> algorithms to create new ones. The measure of correctness used was the
> Variation of Information introduced in [12], which considers the conditional
> entropies between the labels in two segmentations. The results of this
> comparison were largely unexciting, with all of the algorithms and variants
> performing well on ‘easy’ data, and all performing roughly equally badly on
> ‘hard’ data.
