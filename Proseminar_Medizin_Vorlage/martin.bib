  Abstract                 = {We propose a detection and segmentation algorithm for the purposes of fine-grained recognition. The algorithm first detects low-level regions that could potentially belong to the object and then performs a full-object segmentation through propagation. Apart from segmenting the object, we can also `zoom in' on the object, i.e. center it, normalize it for scale, and thus discount the effects of the background. We then show that combining this with a state-of-the-art classification algorithm leads to significant improvements in performance especially for datasets which are considered particularly hard for recognition, e.g. birds species. The proposed algorithm is much more efficient than other known methods in similar scenarios. Our method is also simpler and we apply it here to different classes of objects, e.g. birds, flowers, cats and dogs. We tested the algorithm on a number of benchmark datasets for fine-grained categorization. It outperforms all the known state-of-the-art methods on these datasets, sometimes by as much as 11%. It improves the performance of our baseline algorithm by 3-4%, consistently on all datasets. We also observed more than a 4% improvement in the recognition performance on a challenging large-scale flower dataset, containing 578 species of flowers and 250,000 images.},

Our method consists of two steps, an oriented watershed transform (OWT) to form initial regions from contours, followed by construction of an ultra-metric contour map (UCM) defining a hierarchical segmentation. We provide extensive experimental evaluation to demonstrate that, when coupled to a high-performance contour detector, the OWT-UCM algorithm produces state-of-the-art image segmentations. These hierarchical segmentations can optionally be further refined by user-specified annotations.},

  Abstract                 = {A continuous two-dimensional region is partitioned into a fine rectangular array of sites or "pixels", each pixel having a particular "colour" belonging to a prescribed finite set. The true colouring of the region is unknown but, associated with each pixel, there is a possibly multivariate record which conveys imperfect information about its colour according to a known statistical model. The aim is to reconstruct the true scene, with the additional knowledge that pixels close together tend to have the same or similar colours. In this paper, it is assumed that the local characteristics of the true scene can be represented by a non-degenerate Markov random field. Such information can be combined with the records by Bayes' theorem and the true scene can be estimated according to standard criteria. However, the computational burden is enormous and the reconstruction may reflect undesirable large-scale properties of the random field. Thus, a simple, iterative method of reconstruction is proposed, which does not depend on these large-scale characteristics. The method is illustrated by computer simulations in which the original scene is not directly related to the assumed random field. Some complications, including parameter estimation, are discussed. Potential applications are mentioned briefly.},

We build upon the part-based pose-let detector, which can predict masks for numerous parts of an object. For this purpose we extend poselets to 19 other categories apart from person. We non-rigidly align these part detections to potential object contours in the image, both to increase the precision of the predicted object mask and to sort out false positives. We spatially aggregate object information via a variational smoothing technique while ensuring that object regions do not overlap. Finally, we propose to refine the segmentation based on self-similarity defined on small image patches. We obtain competitive results on the challenging Pascal VOC benchmark. On four classes we achieve the best numbers to-date.},

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds.},

  Abstract                 = {High-level, or holistic, scene understanding involves reasoning about objects, regions, and the 3D relationships between them. This requires a representation above the level of pixels that can be endowed with high-level attributes such as class of object/region, its orientation, and (rough 3D) location within the scene. Towards this goal, we propose a region-based model which combines appearance and scene geometry to automatically decompose a scene into semantically meaningful regions. Our model is defined in terms of a unified energy function over scene appearance and structure. We show how this energy function can be learned from data and present an efficient inference technique that makes use of multiple over-segmentations of the image to propose moves in the energy-space. We show, experimentally, that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the tasks of both multi-class image segmentation and geometric reasoning. Finally, by understanding region classes and geometry, we show how our model can be used as the basis for 3D reconstruction of the scene.},

  Abstract                 = {The watershed transform has interesting properties that make it useful for many different image segmentation applications: it is simple and intuitive, can be parallelized, and always produces a complete division of the image. However, when applied to medical image analysis, it has important drawbacks (oversegmentation, sensitivity to noise, poor detection of thin or low signal to noise ratio structures). We present an improvement to the watershed transform that enables the introduction of prior information in its calculation. We propose to introduce this information via the use of a previous probability calculation. Furthermore, we introduce a method to combine the watershed transform and atlas registration, through the use of markers. We have applied our new algorithm to two challenging applications: knee cartilage and gray matter/white matter segmentation in MR images. Numerical validation of the results is provided, demonstrating the strength of the algorithm for medical image segmentation.},

The features are incorporated into a probabilistic framework, which combines the outputs of several components. Components differ in the information they encode. Some focus on the image-label mapping, while others focus solely on patterns within the label field. Components also differ in their scale, as some focus on fine-resolution patterns while others on coarser, more global structure. A supervised version of the contrastive divergence algorithm is applied to learn these features from labeled image data. We demonstrate performance on two real-world image databases and compare it to a classifier and a Markov random field.},

  Abstract                 = {Segmentation of pulmonary X-ray computed tomography (CT) images is a precursor to most pulmonary image analysis applications. This paper presents a fully automatic method for identifying the lungs in three-dimensional (3-D) pulmonary X-ray CT images. The method has three main steps. First, the lung region is extracted from the CT images by gray-level thresholding. Then, the left and right lungs are separated by identifying the anterior and posterior junctions by dynamic programming. Finally, a sequence of morphological operations is used to smooth the irregular boundary along the mediastinum in order to obtain results consistent with these obtained by manual analysis, in which only the most central pulmonary arteries are excluded from the lung region. The method has been tested by processing 3-D CT data sets from eight normal subjects, each imaged three times at biweekly intervals with lungs at 90% vital capacity. The authors present results by comparing their automatic method to manually traced borders from two image analysts. Averaged over all volumes, the root mean square difference between the computer and human analysis is 0.8 pixels (0.54 mm). The mean intrasubject change in tissue content over the three scans was 2.75%±2.29% (mean±standard deviation).},

  Abstract                 = {Most methods for object class segmentation are formulated as a labelling problem over a single choice of quantisation of an image space - pixels, segments or group of segments. It is well known that each quantisation has its fair share of pros and cons; and the existence of a common optimal quantisation level suitable for all object categories is highly unlikely. Motivated by this observation, we propose a hierarchical random field model, that allows integration of features computed at different levels of the quantisation hierarchy. MAP inference in this model can be performed efficiently using powerful graph cut based move making algorithms. Our framework generalises much of the previous work based on pixels or segments. We evaluate its efficiency on some of the most challenging data-sets for object class segmentation, and show it obtains state-of-the-art results.},

  Abstract                 = {A basic requirement for understanding the dynamics of the Earth's major ecosystems is accurate quantitative information about the distribution and areal extent of the Earth's vegetation formations. Some of this required information can be obtained through the analysis of remotely sensed data. Image segmentation is often one of the first steps of this analysis. This paper focuses on two particular types of segmentation: region-based and edge-based segmentations. Each approach is affected differently by various factors, and both types of segmentations may be improved by taking advantage of their complementary nature. Included among region-based segmentation approaches are region growing methods, which produce hierarchical segmentations of images from finer to coarser resolution. In this hierarchy, an ideal segmentation (ideal for a given application) does not always correspond to one single iteration, but map correspond to several different iterations. This, among other factors, makes it somewhat difficult to choose a stopping criterion for region growing methods. To find the ideal segmentation, the authors develop a stopping criterion for their Iterative Parallel Region Growing (IPRG) algorithm using additional information from edge features, and the Hausdorff distance metric. They integrate information from regions and edges at the symbol level, taking advantage of the hierarchical structure of the region segmentation results. Also, to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in processing the massive amount of data that will be generated by future Earth remote sensing missions, such as the Earth Observing System (EOS), all the different steps of this algorithm have been implemented on a massively parallel processor},

  Abstract                 = {Contours and junctions are important cues for perceptual organization and shape recognition. Detecting junctions locally has proved problematic because the image intensity surface is confusing in the neighborhood of a junction. Edge detectors also do not perform well near junctions. Current leading approaches to junction detection, such as the Harris operator, are based on 2D variation in the intensity signal. However, a drawback of this strategy is that it confuses textured regions with junctions. We believe that the right approach to junction detection should take advantage of the contours that are incident at a junction; contours themselves can be detected by processes that use more global approaches. In this paper, we develop a new high-performance contour detector using a combination of local and global cues. This contour detector provides the best performance to date (F=0.70) on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset (BSDS) benchmark. From the resulting contours, we detect and localize candidate junctions, taking into account both contour salience and geometric configuration. We show that improvements in our contour model lead to better junctions. Our contour and junction detectors both provide state of the art performance.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents an automatic road-sign detection and recognition system based on support vector machines (SVMs). In automatic traffic-sign maintenance and in a visual driver-assistance system, road-sign detection and recognition are two of the most important functions. Our system is able to detect and recognize circular, rectangular, triangular, and octagonal signs and, hence, covers all existing Spanish traffic-sign shapes. Road signs provide drivers important information and help them to drive more safely and more easily by guiding and warning them and thus regulating their actions. The proposed recognition system is based on the generalization properties of SVMs. The system consists of three stages: 1) segmentation according to the color of the pixel; 2) traffic-sign detection by shape classification using linear SVMs; and 3) content recognition based on Gaussian-kernel SVMs. Because of the used segmentation stage by red, blue, yellow, white, or combinations of these colors, all traffic signs can be detected, and some of them can be detected by several colors. Results show a high success rate and a very low amount of false positives in the final recognition stage. From these results, we can conclude that the proposed algorithm is invariant to translation, rotation, scale, and, in many situations, even to partial occlusions},

  Abstract                 = {We propose an approach to the problem of detecting and segmenting generic object classes that combines three "off the shelf" components in a novel way. The components are a generic image segmenter that returns a set of "super pixels" at different scales; a generic classifier that can determine if an image region (such as one or more super pixels) contains (part of) the foreground object or not; and a generic belief propagation (BP) procedure for tree-structured graphical models. Our system combines the regions together into a hierarchical, tree-structured conditional random field, applies the classifier to each node (region), and fuses all the information together using belief propagation. Since our classifiers only rely on color and texture, they can handle deformable (non-rigid) objects such as animals, even under severe occlusion and rotation. We demonstrate good results for detecting and segmenting cows, cats and cars on the very challenging Pascal VOC dataset.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce the term cosegmentation which denotes the task of segmenting simultaneously the common parts of an image pair. A generative model for cosegmentation is presented. Inference in the model leads to minimizing an energy with an MRF term encoding spatial coherency and a global constraint which attempts to match the appearance histograms of the common parts. This energy has not been proposed previously and its optimization is challenging and NP-hard. For this problem a novel optimization scheme which we call trust region graph cuts is presented. We demonstrate that this framework has the potential to improve a wide range of research: Object driven image retrieval, video tracking and segmentation, and interactive image editing. The power of the framework lies in its generality, the common part can be a rigid/non-rigid object (or scene), observed from different viewpoints or even similar objects of the same class.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose semantic texton forests, efficient and powerful new low-level features. These are ensembles of decision trees that act directly on image pixels, and therefore do not need the expensive computation of filter-bank responses or local descriptors. They are extremely fast to both train and test, especially compared with k-means clustering and nearest-neighbor assignment of feature descriptors. The nodes in the trees provide (i) an implicit hierarchical clustering into semantic textons, and (ii) an explicit local classification estimate. Our second contribution, the bag of semantic textons, combines a histogram of semantic textons over an image region with a region prior category distribution. The bag of semantic textons is computed over the whole image for categorization, and over local rectangular regions for segmentation. Including both histogram and region prior allows our segmentation algorithm to exploit both textural and semantic context. Our third contribution is an image-level prior for segmentation that emphasizes those categories that the automatic categorization believes to be present. We evaluate on two datasets including the very challenging VOC 2007 segmentation dataset. Our results significantly advance the state-of-the-art in segmentation accuracy, and furthermore, our use of efficient decision forests gives at least a five-fold increase in execution speed.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent advances in 3D depth cameras such as Microsoft Kinect sensors (www.xbox.com/en-US/kinect) have created many opportunities for multimedia computing. The Kinect sensor lets the computer directly sense the third dimension (depth) of the players and the environment. It also understands when users talk, knows who they are when they walk up to it, and can interpret their movements and translate them into a format that developers can use to build new experiences. While the Kinect sensor incorporates several advanced sensing hardware, this article focuses on the vision aspect of the Kinect sensor and its impact beyond the gaming industry.},
