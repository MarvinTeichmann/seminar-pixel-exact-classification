\subsection{Markov Random Fields}\label{subsec:markov-random-fields}
\Glspl{MRF} are undirected probabilistic graphical models. In the associated
graph $G=(\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$, nodes represent random variables and
edges represent conditional dependencies. Inference is done with the \gls{MAP}
estimation and training with a maximum likelihood approach or
\gls{ICM}~\cite{10.2307/2345426}.

Typically, a random variable represents a class relationship of a single pixel
and edges represent pixel neighborhood in computer vision problems segmentation problems
where \glspl{MRF} are used. The pixel neighborhood might either be a
4-neighborhood (north, east, south west) or an 8-neighborhood (north,
north-east, east, south-east, south, south-west, west, north-west).

For example, say $\mathbf{x}$ is the feature vector from an image, $\mathbf{y}$
is the vector of random variables. Then the conditional probability of $\mathbf{y}$
given $\mathbf{x}$ can be expressed as
\[P(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{Z(\mathbf{x})} \exp(-E(\mathbf{y};\mathbf{x}))\]
where $Z(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{\mathbf{y}} \exp(-E(\mathbf{y};\mathbf{x}))$ is
a normalization term called the \textit{partition function}.

Typically, the energy function $E$ is of the structure

\[E(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i \in \mathcal{V}} \psi_i^U (y_i; \mathbf{x}) + \sum_{ij \in \mathcal{E}} \psi_{ij}^P(y_i, y_j, \mathbf{x}) + \sum_{c \in \mathcal{C}} \psi_c^H(\mathbf{y}_c; \mathbf{x})\]

where $\psi_i^U$ represents unary terms, $\psi_{ij}^P$ represents pairwise
terms and $\psi_c^H$ represents higher-order terms. $\mathcal{C}$ is the set
of all cliques in $G$.


\Glspl{MRF} are a very wide-spread model in computer vision. Excellent
introductions to \glspl{MRF} are given by
\cite{blake2011markov,murphy2012machine}.


% Where / how it was used.
Grid-like / pairwise \gls{MRF} is used in~\cite{rother2004grabcut}.

Other \glspl{MRF}: \cite{zhang2001segmentation} and \cite{moser2012markov}.

\cite{shotton2006textonboost} uses a 4-connected grid.

% Characterizations of MRF:
% Label space: binary vs multi-label; homogeneous vs heterogeneous
% Order: unary vs pairwise vs higher-order
% Structure: chain vs tree vs grid vs general graph; neighborhood size
% Potentials: submodular, convex, compressible

% Segmentation of brain MR images through a hidden Markov random field model
% and the expectation-maximization algorithm \cite{zhang2001segmentation}

% In short: specify locally and model globally.

% define only local properties. allows by transitivity to get a model
% for global properties.


% \begin{itemize}
%     \item What is your set of random models? (e.g. Ising model: one for each pixel)
%           \begin{itemize}
%               \item Irving-Model: \cite{boykov2000interactive}
%               \item Potts-Model: \cite{boykov2001fast}
%           \end{itemize}
% \end{itemize}

% On those, define an undirected hypergraph $G(V, E)$. $V$ are pixels, $E$ is
% typically defined by neighboring pixels.

% good:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Convenient modeling:Just write down energy function (in some cases)
%           do define entire model
%     \item fast inference (only 1 or 2 variants)
%     \item sometimes good performance
% \end{itemize}

% bad:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item learning is difficult
% \end{itemize}


% From \cite{yang2012layered}:

% Markov Random Field (MRF) models which enforce smoothness across pixel labels

\subsection{Conditional Random Fields}\label{subsec:conditional-random-fields}

\Glspl{CRF} are \glspl{MRF} where all clique potentials are conditioned on
input features~\cite{murphy2012machine}. % TODO: What exactly does that mean? Which implications does it have?

\Glspl{CRF} are used in \cite{multiscale04,shotton2006textonboost}.

\Glspl{CRF} as described in~\cite{associative09} have reached top performance
in PASCAL VOC 2010~\cite{VOC2010Results}.

% An Introduction to Conditional Random Fields

A method similar to \glspl{CRF} was proposed in~\cite{gonfaus2010harmony}.
The system of Gonfaus~et.al. ranked~1st by mean accuracy in the segmentation
task of the PASCAL VOC 2010 challenge~\cite{everingham2010pascal}.
