\section{Traditional Approaches}\label{sec:traditional-approaches}%
Image segmentation algorithms which use traditional approaches, hence don't
apply neural networks and make heavy use of domain knowledge, are wide-spread
in the computer vision community. Features which can be used for segmentation
are described in \cref{subsec:features}, a very brief overview of unsupervised,
non-semantic segmentation is given in
\cref{subsec:unsupervised-traditional-segmentation}, Random Decision
Forests are described in \cref{subsec:random-forests}
%, Markov Random Fields in \cref{subsec:markov-random-fields}
 and \glspl{SVM} in
\cref{subsec:trad-SVM}.
Postprocessing is covered in \cref{subsec:post-processing-methods}.

It should be noted that algorithms can use combination of methods. For example,
\cite{tighe2014scene} makes use of a combination of a \gls{SVM} and a
\gls{MRF}.

% TODO: The respective advantages of the classifiers are discussed in
% \cref{subsec:traditional-approaches-discussion}.

% \subsection{Discussion}\label{subsec:traditional-approaches-discussion}%
% According to \cite{pantofaru2005comparison}, the mean shift algorithm produces
% segmentations that correspond well to human perception, but it is sensitive to
% its parameters. Depending on them, different granularities of the segmentation
% can be achieved. \cite{pantofaru2005comparison} draws the conclusion, that
% the segmentations found by the graph based image segmentation approach
% in \cite{felzenszwalb2004efficient} are inferior to the segmentations found
% by the mean shift algorithm described in \cite{comaniciu2002mean}.
