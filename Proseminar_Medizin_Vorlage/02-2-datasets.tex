\subsection{Datasets}

The computer vision community produced a couple of different datasets which are
publicly available. In the following, only the most widely used ones are
described. An overview over the quantity and the kind of data is given by
\cref{table:segmentation-databases}.


\subsubsection{PASCAL VOC}

The PASCAL\footnote{\textbf{p}attern \textbf{a}nalysis, \textbf{s}tatistical
modelling and \textbf{c}omput\textbf{a}tional \textbf{l}earning, an EU network
of excellence} VOC\footnote{\textbf{V}isual \textbf{O}bject \textbf{C}lasses}
challenge was organized eight times with different datasets: Once every year
from 2005 to 2012~\cite{pascal-voc-2012}. Beginning with~2007, a segmentation
challenge was added~\cite{pascal-voc-2007}.

The dataset consists of annotated photographs from www.flicker.com, a photo
sharing website. There are multiple challenges for PASCAL VOC. The 2012
competition had 5~challenges of which one is a segmentation challenge where
a single class label was given for each pixel.

Although no new competitions will be held, new algorithms can be evaluated on
the 2010, 2011 and 2012 data via
\href{http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk:8080/}{http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk:8080/}

The PASCAL VOC segmentation challenges use the \textit{segmentation over union}
criterion (see \cref{subsec:quality-measures}).


\subsubsection{MSRCv2}

Microsoft Research has published a database of 591 photographs with pixel-wise
annotation of 21~classes: aeroplane, bike, bird, boat, body,
book, building, car, cat, chair, cow, dog, face, flower, grass, road, sheep,
sign, sky, tree, water. Additionally, there is a \texttt{void} label for pixels
which do not belong to any of the 21~classes or which are close to the
segmentation boundary. This allows a \enquote{rough and quick hand-segmentation
which does not align exactly with the object boundaries}~\cite{shotton2006textonboost}.

The dataset is described in~\cite{shotton2006textonboost}.

\subsubsection{Medical Databases}

The Warwick-QU Dataset consists of 165~images with pixel-wise annotation of
5~classes: \enquote{healthy, adenomatous, moderately differentiated,
moderately-to-poorly differentiated, and poorly
differentiated}~\cite{coelho2009nuclear}. This dataset is part of the
Gland Segmentation (GlaS) challenge.

The DIARETDB1~\cite{kalesnykiene2014diaretdb1} is a dataset of 89~images fundus
images. Those images show the interior surface of the eye. Fundus images can
be used to detect diabetic retinopathy. The images have four classes of coarse
annotations: hard and soft exudates, hemorrhages and red small dots.

20~test and additionally 20~training retinal fundus images are available
through the DRIVE data set~\cite{staal2004ridge}. The vessels were annotated.
Additionally, \cite{azzopardi2011detection} added vascular features.
