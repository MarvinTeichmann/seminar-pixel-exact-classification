\begin{abstract}
This survey gives an overview over different techniques used for pixel-level
semantic segmentation. It is based on an extensive literature review. Metrics
and datasets for the evaluation of segmentation algorithms, traditional
approaches for segmentation as well as recently published approaches with
convolutional neural networks and typical problematic situations for segmentation
algorithms are examined.
